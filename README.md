The only app you need to manage your course work at U of I.

## Development

### Connecting to a local instance of the API
#### Android Emulator
To connect to the API locally, you'll need to modify the API's base endpoint in your .env file. Use `10.0.2.2:<port>` as host, filling in `<port>` with the port you're running the API from. The IP `10.0.2.2` routes from the Android VM to `localhost`.
